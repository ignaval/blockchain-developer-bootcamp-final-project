# ETHouses DAO
## Consensys Academy blockchain developer bootcamp final project

[ETHouses](https://ethouses.io) token holders will be able to submit new representation algorithms for the tokens, and they will be able to vote on proposed representations to be included in the smart contract. Hosted at dao.ethouses.io.

Representation algorithms are submitted as media files, description, title and code (all publicly visible).

The submitting and voting happen within an election time frame, that repeats twice a year automatically, with no input from the contract owner or anyone.

### Proposing (included in final project)
1. Users sign a message proving they own tokens
2. Users can submit a new representation algorithm to be voted on the current election

### Voting (not included in final project)
1. Users sign a message proving they own tokens
2. Users can cast a vote per token they hold, upvoting a representation in the current election
3. Users can flag proposals (copies or inappropriate)
